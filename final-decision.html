    <h1>AP Physics II mid-term survival guide</h1>
    <h3>objective</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To allow AP Physics II students to learn the 4 topics they would be tested on on their mid-term exam</li>
        <li>To allow Mr.Lo, the teacher, to communicate infromation not mentioned in class to students</li>
        <li>To allow AP Physics II students to find a reliable source of exercises and practice quesitons</li>
        <li>To allow Honor Physics students to have an idea about what they would learn in AP Physics II</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>success criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The website has notes for each of the 4 topics that would be accessed on the mid-term</li>
        <li>The website has labs for each of the 4 topics that would be accessed on the mid-term</li>
        <li>The website has practice questions for each of the 4 topics that would be accessed on the mid-term</li>
        <li>The website is accessbile for all students in AIS</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>client</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mr. Lo</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>audience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AP Physics II students who want to learn the topics on the mid-term exam</li>
        <li>AP Physics II students who want to do some practice questions</li>
        <li>Parents of AP Physics II students who want to see what their children are learning in AP Physics II class</li>
        <li>Students who might be interested in studying AP physics II in the future</li>

    <h3>further resesarch about this project</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Similar websites</li>
      <a herf="http://www.physicsclassroom.com"> <p>physics classroom</p></a>
      <p>This website seems to be a "professional version" of our idea</p>
      <p>Maybe we could based off our design and content from this website but make it more easier to read</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes made after meeting Mr.Lo</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>learning based on experiment</li>
        <li>focus on one topic - kinetics</li>
        <li>be <strong>carzy</strong>, be <strong>fun</strong></li>
        <li>include a video to attract the students to learn</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>New objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>To allow AP Physics II students to learn about kinetics through a lab</li>
        <li>To allow AP Physics II students to see practice questions on kinetics</li>
        <li>To allow Mr.Lo,the teacher, to communicate infromation not mentioned in class to students</li>
        <li>To allow Honor Physics students to have an idea about what they would learn about kinetics in AP Physics II</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>New success criteria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The website contain notes on kinetics</li>
        <li>The website has an interactive lab about kinetics</li>
        <li>The website has a summary about what students should have learned from the notes and the lab</li>
        <li>The website has a set of practice questions about kinetics</li>
        <li>The website has the answer key to the practice questions</li>
      </ul>
